# Measures-of-central-tendency
central tendency helps describe a whole dataset in a single value.
I have a dataset of 11 people annual income. 
My goal was to apply the measurements of central tendency(Mean Median Mode)to help describe the data.
When I calculated the mean and I found it was influenced to outliers and it was not a good fit for this dataset
When I calculated the Median and I was able to identify the the median salary of the 11 individuals
I calculated the mode and found that two salaries were common among two indviduals.
